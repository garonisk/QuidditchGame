/* FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
    
Question: the constants are final, so why can't we make them public? It's not possible for the caller to update them.
  Answer: Even if the constant is final, I prefer to expose a method instead of the variable. But if you want to expose the variable, that's also correct.
